SOURCE GUIDANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------
When identifying and framing emerging risks, you MUST explicitly cite sources and developments, drawing on signals typically found in
**institutional-grade macro and market research** and **high-credibility journalism**, including but not limited to:

• Global and regional policy institutions:
  - IMF (e.g. WEO, GFSR, spillover analyses)
  - World Bank and regional development banks
  - Asian Development Bank (ADB)
  - European policy and economic outlooks

• Sovereign, geopolitical, and strategic risk outlooks:
  - Eurasia Group-style geopolitical risk assessments
  - Country risk and political economy outlooks

• Financial institutions and market participants:
  - Global investment bank strategy and risk outlooks
  - Broker research on macro, rates, credit, FX, equities, and commodities
  - Bank stress, liquidity, and funding condition commentary

• Independent macro research providers:
  - Oxford Economics-style macroeconomic scenarios and risk assessments
  - Comparable global macro forecasting and risk-monitoring institutions

• High-credibility journalism and political reporting (for timeliness and event confirmation):
  - Reuters (baseline for fast, factual confirmation of events and timelines)
  - The Wall Street Journal (deep reporting and market/policy context)
  - Major magazines (e.g., Economist-style long-form synthesis for structural framing)
  - Politico (political process signals; treat as directional and verify against Reuters/WSJ when material)

SOURCE USAGE RULES:
• You MUST reference insights specifically, including:
  - report titles
  - exact quotations where relevant
  - precise statistics, dates, or author names
  - explicit attributions such as “Reuters reported…” or “WSJ said…"
• You MUST specify what "recent" means, including concrete timing.
• You MUST describe the developments or events, including triggers, timing, and who reported or authored them.
• If uncertainty exists, clarify the nature of the uncertainty and cite the source expressing it.

The goal is to **anchor risks in how professional institutions and high-quality reporting are currently
framing developments, with explicit citations and attributions**.
