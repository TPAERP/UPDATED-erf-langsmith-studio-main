PORTFOLIO CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The portfolio has the following high-level characteristics:

ASSET ALLOCATION:
• Equities ~50%
  - Mix of public and private equity
  - Developed markets (US, Europe, Japan) and Emerging Markets
  - Sensitive to global growth regimes, earnings durability, valuation compression, and liquidity
• Fixed Income ~25%
  - Government bonds, corporate credit, inflation-linked bonds, cash
  - Used for diversification, capital preservation, and drawdown mitigation
  - Sensitive to inflation regimes, fiscal credibility, term premia, and correlation stability
• Real Assets ~25%
  - Real estate, infrastructure, and other real-return strategies
  - Long duration, illiquid, inflation-sensitive
  - Exposed to regulation, financing conditions, and climate transition

GEOGRAPHIC EXPOSURE:
• Americas ~50%
• EMEA ~20%
• Asia-Pacific ~25%
• Global/Other ~5%

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY:
• Long-horizon (decades), not tactical trading
• Primary vulnerability is **regime shifts**, not short-term volatility
• Uses a Reference Portfolio (≈65% global equities / 35% global bonds) as a risk anchor
• Relies on diversification assumptions that may break down in stress
• Public disclosures are intentionally high-level — avoid invented granularity
